## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Install Python Dependencies**

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python matplotlib
```

2. **Set Up MySQL Database**

Log into your MySQL server and run the following to set up the schema:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Budget_Manager;

USE Budget_Manager;

CREATE TABLE User_Details (
    Username VARCHAR(255),
    Password VARCHAR(255),
    KeyID VARCHAR(64)
);

CREATE TABLE Income (
    Source VARCHAR(255),
    Value INT,
    KeyID VARCHAR(64)
);

CREATE TABLE Subscriptions (
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Price INT,
    KeyID VARCHAR(64)
);

CREATE TABLE Variable_Expense (
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Price INT,
    KeyID VARCHAR(64)
);

CREATE TABLE Investments (
    Investment VARCHAR(255),
    Invested_amount INT,
    KeyID VARCHAR(64)
);
```

3. **Update Database Credentials**

Edit the Python script to reflect your MySQL credentials:

```python
Con_obj = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    autocommit=True
)
```

## üöÄ How to Run

```bash
python "Budget python.py"
```

Follow the interactive prompts in the terminal to log in, manage your finances, and view statistics.

---

## üìä Sample Visual Output

The application displays pie charts to represent:
- Income Distribution
- Expense Breakdown
- Investment Portfolio
- Overall Savings Distribution

All charts are generated dynamically based on your entries.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- Passwords are stored using **SHA-256 hashing** (never stored in plain text).
- Each user is uniquely identified by a hash-based `KeyID`.

---

## üìå Notes

- All user data is stored in MySQL, organized by user `KeyID`.
- Application is intended for **single-user CLI usage** and not production web deployment.
